The Moran Process is the standard stochastic model of evolution [Moran, 1962; Nowak 2006]. The Moran process is a Markov process in which, for each time step, two individuals are chosen: one for reproduction and the other for elimination. The process is defined over the state space by the designation of transition probabilities given by a transition matrix between adjacent states. Here we use the Moran process to model the evolution of a population with two types in intraspecific conflict.

The parameters determining the process are the interaction structure of the population (given by the 2X2 game), population size, mutation rate, and intensity of selection (the contribution of the game to the organismsâ€™ net fitness).
